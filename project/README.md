# Project Kanban

This folder contains task cards derived from `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

Columns:
- `backlog/`: ready or planned work not started yet.
- `in-progress/`: currently implemented.
- `review/`: implemented and waiting for validation.
- `done/`: completed and accepted.
- `blocked/`: paused tasks with explicit blocking reason.

Conventions:
- One markdown file per task.
- Filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-task-XXX-short-title.md`.
- Keep task metadata both in frontmatter and in the task body for quick scanning.
